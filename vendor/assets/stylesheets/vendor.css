/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * DO NOT include blueprint directely in .css but have the assets precompiled
 * (look in production.rb, config.assets.precompile) and the client
 * choose what to download
 * require_tree ../../../vendor/assets/stylesheets/blueprint
 *
 *= require_tree ../../../vendor/assets/stylesheets/jquery-ui
 *= require_self
